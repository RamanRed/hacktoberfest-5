Hints for Common Errors
As you explore the code, you may encounter some intentional faults to enhance your learning experience. Here are some hints to guide you:

Variable Naming: Pay attention to the consistency of variable names. Ensure that the name used to access the URL in the promise matches the defined name. Look for any discrepancies.

File Write Operations: Think about how the file write operation for saving the URL is functioning. Are there any potential asynchronous issues or errors that might occur during file operations?

Error Handling: Consider the error handling logic in the application. Does it effectively account for different types of errors that may arise during user input or file operations?

Prompt Rendering: If you encounter issues with the prompt not rendering, reflect on the environment where the application is running. Is it capable of displaying command-line prompts correctly?
